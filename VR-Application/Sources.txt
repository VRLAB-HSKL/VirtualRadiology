// Paper zu Grauwerten bei medizinischen Bildern 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043920/#:~:text=This%20means%20that%20a%20human,dark%20compared%20to%20bright%20environment.

"Visualization is also often limited to 8 bits because most viewing applications only support 8 bits or 256 shades of gray. 
Moreover, for high-resolution displays, the available bandwidth on the link between graphical board and the display also becomes a bottleneck and makes it difficult to transmit more than 8 bits/pixel over the link.
 To overcome this large difference in bit depth between source images and rendered images and to avoid that critical image information is lost, radiologists have the possibility to apply window leveling to the displayed images.
 In this way, all grayscales present in the input image can be visualized sequentially in time by mapping part of the input grayscales to the available gray levels of the display.
 Of course window leveling increases the time needed to analyze a medical image."
